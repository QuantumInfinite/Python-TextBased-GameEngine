# Python-TextBased-GameEngine

This is a text based game engine written in Python that uses the Curses library, meaning it can only be run on linux. Editor.py is the program for creating new stories, and jubjub.py (don't ask) is for playing them. TheRedLetter is a short story I found online which I converted to a playable game
